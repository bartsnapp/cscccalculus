\begin{exercise}
Find the equation of the plane that passes through the points $(1,-1,2)$, $(0,3,2)$, and $(4,1,2)$.  Express your final answer in the form $ax+by+cz=d$, where $c$ is positive, and $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ have no common factors.

\[
\answer{0}x+\answer{0}y+\answer{1}z=\answer{2}
\]

\begin{feedback}[correct]
In retrospect, could you have guessed the answer by inspection?
