\outcome{Find the equation of a plane given three points.}

\begin{document}
\begin{exercise}
Find the equation of the plane that passes through the points $(1,2,0)$, $(-1,1,1)$, and $(2,0,0)$.  Express your final answer in the form $ax+by+cz=d$, where $a$ is positive, and $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ have no common factors.

\[
\answer{2}x+\answer{1}y+\answer{5}z=\answer{4}
\]

\begin{hint}
Use the three points to find two vectors that are parallel to the plane.  How can you find a vector that is orthogonal to both of these vectors?
