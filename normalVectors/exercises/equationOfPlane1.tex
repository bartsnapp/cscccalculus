\begin{exercise}
Find the equation of a plane that is parallel to the plane $2x-3y+4z=8$ that passes through $(2,9,3)$ by following the steps below.

A vector normal to the plane is $\vector{2,\answer{-3},\answer{4}}$

The equation of the plane is 

\[
2\left(x-\answer{2}\right) + \left( \answer{-3} \right)\left(y-\answer{9}\right)+ \left( \answer{4} \right)\left(z-\answer{3}\right) =0.
\]

We can write this in the form $ax+by+cz=d$ using the above and find:

\[
2x+ \left(\answer{-3} \right)y+\left(\answer{4}\right)z= \answer{-11}.
\]
