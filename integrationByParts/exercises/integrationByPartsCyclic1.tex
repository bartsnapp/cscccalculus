\outcome{Evaluate integrals using integration by parts, including mulitple iterations}


\begin{document}
\begin{exercise}
Consider the integral $I = \int e^{2x}\sin(4x) \d x $.

For this integral, note that there is no polynomial term, so the integration by parts procedure will not terminate in a similar manner as previous integrals.  However, by choosing either the exponential or the trigonometric function for $u$ and the other for $\d v$, performing the integration by parts procedure repeatedly will eventually return the original choice for $u$ and $\d v$.  This will allow for us to use the integration by parts procedure to find the original integral.

First, set $u = \sin(4x)$ and $\d v =  e^{2x}$.  Then, $\d u = \answer{4 \cos(4x)} \d x$ and $v = \answer{\frac{1}{2}e^{2x}}$.  Applying the integration by parts procedure gives:

\[
I = \answer{\frac{1}{2} e^{2x}\sin(4x)}-\int \answer{2 e^{2x}\cos(4x)} \d x
\] 

\begin{exercise}
Applying this procedure again, and being consistent with the type of function we use for $u$ and $\d v$ gives:

\begin{align*}
u  &=  \answer{\cos(4x)} & \d v &= 2 \answer{e^{2x}} \d x \\
\d u &= \answer{-4\sin(4x)} \d x & v &= \answer{ e^{2x}}
\end{align*}

Applying the integration by parts procedure gives:

\[
I = \frac{1}{2}e^{2x}\sin(4x)-\left(\answer{e^{2x}\cos(4x)} - \int \answer{-4 e^{2x}\sin(4x)} \d x \right)
\] 

\begin{exercise}
Simplifying this gives:

\[
I = \frac{1}{2}e^{2x}\sin(4x)-e^{2x}\cos(4x) - 4 \int \answer{e^{2x}\sin(4x)} \d x 
\] 

Note that the original integral has appeared again!  We can thus write the above as:

\[
I = \frac{1}{2}e^{2x}\sin(4x)-e^{2x}\cos(4x) - 4 I 
\] 

This is an algebraic equation in $I$.  Solve it to find the value of the original integral:

\[
I = \answer{\frac{1}{10}e^{2x}\sin(4x)-\frac{1}{5}e^{2x}\cos(4x) +C}
\] 

(Use $C$ for the constant of integration)

\begin{hint}
Add $4I$ to both sides, then divide by $5$ and add a constant of integration.
\end{hint}

\begin{exercise}
To assure the validity of this process, we check our answer by differentiating:

\[
\ddx \left[\frac{1}{10} e^{2x}\sin(4x) \right] = \answer{\frac{1}{5}e^{2x}\sin(4x)+\frac{2}{5} e^{2x} \cos(4x)}
\]

\[
\ddx \left[\frac{1}{5} e^{2x}\cos(4x) \right] = \answer{\frac{2}{5}e^{2x}\cos(4x)-\frac{4}{5} e^{2x} \sin(4x)}
\]

\begin{exercise}
Thus:

\[
\ddx \left[\frac{1}{10}e^{2x}\sin(4x)-\frac{1}{5}e^{2x}\cos(4x) +C\right] = \answer{e^{2x}\sin(4x)}
\] 
and the antiderivatives computed in this example are correct!
