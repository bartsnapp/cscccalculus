\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Implicitly differentiate expression.
	%\item Solve equations for $\dd[y]{x}$.
	\item Find the equation of the tangent line for curves that
          are not plots of functions.
	\item Understand how changing the variable changes how we take
          the derivative.
	\item Understand the derivatives of functions that are not
         defined explicitly in terms of an independent variable .
          \item Explain the formula for the derivative of the natural log function.
	\item Calculate derivatives of logs in any base.
	\item Calculate the derivative of an exponential function, $a^x$, where $a>0$.
\end{itemize}
