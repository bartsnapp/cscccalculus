\begin{exercise}
Suppose that $S$ is a surface and the following is known.

\begin{itemize}
\item The level curve corresponding to $z=1$ is $x^2+3y=4$.
\item The level curve corresponding to $z=2$ is $2x^2+y=8$.
\end{itemize}

From the given information, how many points $(a,b) \in \R^2$ are there for which that $\lim_{\vector{x,y} \to \vector{a,b}} z(x,y)$ \emph{must} not exist?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{None}
\choice{One}
\choice[correct]{Two}
\choice{Three}
\choice{More than three, but finitely many}
\choice{Infinitely many}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{exercise}
The points $(a,b) \in \R^2$ for which $\lim_{\vector{x,y} \to \vector{a,b}} z(x,y)$ does not exist are 

\[
\left(\answer{-2},\answer{0}\right) \textrm{ and } \left(\answer{2},\answer{0}\right)
\]
(in your response, list the point with the smaller $x$-coordinate first)



\begin{hint}
The level curves are paths in the domain along which $z$ is constant.  Since we have two different level curves, any point in the $xy$-plane where they intersect will be a point on the surface for which there are multiple $z$-values, and hence, where $\lim_{\vector{x,y} \to \vector{a,b}} z(x,y)$ will not exist.

\begin{itemize}
\item For the level curve along which $z=1$, we have $y = \answer{\frac{4}{3}-\frac{1}{3}x^2}$.
\item For the level curve along which $z=2$, we have $y = \answer{8-2x^2}$.
\end{itemize}

Setting these equal gives $x=\answer{-2}$ and $x=\answer{2}$ (type the smaller $x$-value first).  Now, find the $y$-values associated to each.
