\begin{exercise}
Consider the polar curve $r = a+5\tan(\theta)$.  For which values of $a$ does the curve intersect the origin?

The curve intersects the origin if $\answer{-\infty} \leq a \leq \answer{\infty}$.

\begin{hint}
The curve will intersect the origin if there is a value of $\theta$ that allows for $r$ to be $0$.  Setting $r=0$ gives:

\[
0 = \answer{a+5 \tan(\theta)}
\]
The question can now be reformulated as: 
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{``For which values of $a$ does this equation have a solution?''}
\choice{``Solve the expression for $\theta$''.}
\end{multipleChoice}

The range of $\tan(\theta)$ is: $\left(\answer{-\infty},\answer{\infty}\right)$, so are there any restrictions on $a$?  For which finite $a$-values can $a+5 \tan(\theta)$ not be $0$?
\end{hint}

Make sure that you use Desmos to graph the polar curve $r = a+5\sin(\theta)$ for several choice of $a$ so you can see visually what is happening in this problem!
