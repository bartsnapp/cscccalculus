%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%PROBLEM 1
\section{Discussion Questions:}
\begin{problem}
Consider the region in the first quadrant bounded above by $y = 4-x^2$. Without evaluating any integrals, determine which of the following solids has the largest volume.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the solid whose cross-sections parallel to the $x$-axis are isosceles right triangles with hypotenuse on the base.
	\item the solid whose cross-sections parallel to the $x$-axis are squares.
	\item the solid whose cross-sections parallel to the $x$-axis are semicircles.
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{freeResponse}
All three solids have the same base, so the solid with the largest volume is the solid whose cross-sections have the greatest area. Of these, the square (b) has the greatest area, followed by the semicircle, (c) then the isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse on the base. To see this, note that if the base of the square, semicircle, and isosceles right triangle each have length $\ell$, then their areas are $\ell^2$, $\frac{\pi \ell^2}{8}$, and $\frac{\ell^2}{4}$, respectively. Since $1 > \frac{\pi}{8} > \frac{1}{4}$, the solids from largest to smallest are as indicated above.
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%PROBLEM 2
\begin{problem}	
Without evaluating any integrals, determine which of the following solids has the largest volume. Each of the solids has cross-sections perpendicular to the $y$-axis that are isosceles right triangles with legs on the base.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the solid whose base is the region in the first quadrant bounded above by $y = 4-x^2$
	\item the solid whose base is the region in the first quadrant bounded above by $y = 4-4x^2$
	\item the solid whose base is the region in the first quadrant bounded above by $y=1$ and to the right by $x=6$
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{freeResponse}
Note that the base for the solid in (b) fits entirely inside the base for the solid in (b). Since the cross-sections of all three solids are the same shape, this means that the solid in (b) fits entirely inside the solid in (a), so we only need to compare solids (a) and (c). 

To do this without using any integrals, instead compare solid (a) to a different solid that is slightly bigger, but possibly smaller than solid (c) still. Consider the solid whose base is the region in the first quadrant bounded by $y=4$ and $x=2$, again with cross-sections perpendicular to the $y$-axis that are isosceles right triangles with legs on the base. Solid (a) has volume no larger than this new solid, which has volume $\frac12 (\text{base})(\text{height})(\text{length}) = \frac12  (2)^2 4 = 8$.

Meanwhile, solid (c) has volume $\frac12 (\text{base})(\text{height})(\text{length}) = \frac12 (6)^2 1 = 18$. Thus solid (c) is the largest.
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%PROBLEM 3
\begin{problem}	
A solid with known cross-sections is described below.  Determine whether an integral or sum of integrals with respect to $x$ or $y$ should be used to find the volume.  Then, determine the minimum number of integrals required to compute the volume.
\begin{enumerate}
\item the solid whose base is the region below and whose cross-sections perpendicular to the $y$-axis are squares.	
\item the solid whose base is the region below and whose cross-sections parallel to the $x$-axis are semicircles.
\end{enumerate}

Set up the integral(s) required in order to compute the volume of the following solids. Do not evaluate.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the solid whose base is the region bounded between $y= x^2+5$ and $y = 8x-2$ and whose cross-sections parallel to the $y$-axis are squares

	To set up the integral, we need to find the $x$-values where $y = x^2+5$ and $y=8x-2$ intersect. Set $x^2+5 = 8x-2$ and solve for $x$:
	\[
	x^2+5 = 8x-2 \quad\Rightarrow\quad x^2-8x+7=0 \quad \Rightarrow\quad x=1, x=7.
	\]
	The cross-sections are squares, so each has area 
	\[
	\text{Area} = \left(\left(8x-2\right) - \left(x^2+5 \right) \right)^2 = \left(-x^2+8x -7 \right)^2.

	To set up the integral, we need to find the $x$-values where $y = \sqrt{3-x}$ and $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x+3}}$ intersect. Set $\sqrt{3-x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x+3}}$ and solve for $x$:
	\[
	\sqrt{3-x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x+3}} \quad\Rightarrow\quad 3-x = \frac{1}{x+3} \quad \Rightarrow\quad -x^2+9 = 1 \quad\Rightarrow\quad x= \pm \sqrt{8}
	\]	
	The cross-sections are equilateral triangles, so each has area $\text{Area} = \frac12 (\text{base})(\text{height})$. To determine the height of an equilateral triangle, recall that each of the interior angles is $\frac{\pi}{3}$, so the height is the length of the longer leg of a 30-60-90 triangle:

	\]
	Putting everything together, the integral that gives the volume of the solid is

	\end{center}
	The cross-sections are squares, so each has area 
	\[
	\text{Area} = \left( 6\sqrt{x}+1\right)^2 = 36 x + 12\sqrt{x} +1.
	\]
	Now we evaluate the integral the gives the volume of the solid:
	\begin{align*}
		\int_0^4  \left( 36x + 12\sqrt{x} +1 \right) \d x	&=	\left[ 18 x^2 + 8 x^{\frac 32} +x \right]_0^4 = 356.
	\end{align*}
	\item Note that this solid has the same base as the solid in part (a) of Problem 3, but here the cross-sections are with respect to $x$, so the integral will be with respect to $x$. Consequently, we will only need one integral.

	\end{center}
	To set up the integral, we need to find the values of $x$ where $y = \sin(x)$ and $y = \cos(x)$ intersect. Setting $\sin(x)=\cos(x)$, we find that $x= \frac{\pi}{4} + n \pi$, where $n$ is any integer. Since the base has $x$-values with $0 \leq x \leq 2\pi$, the two intersection points occur when $x= \frac{\pi}{4}$ and $x= \frac{5\pi}{4}$. 
	
	The cross-sections are isosceles right triangles with legs on the base, so each has area 
	\[
	\text{Area} = \frac12 \left( \sin(x) - \cos(x) \right)^2 = \frac12 \sin^2(x) - \sin(x)\cos(x) + \frac12 \cos^2(x).
	\]
	Now we evaluate the integral the gives the volume of the solid:
	\begin{align*}
		\int_{\frac \pi 4}^{\frac{5\pi}{4}} &\left( \frac12 \sin^2(x) - \sin(x)\cos(x) + \frac12 \cos^2(x)\right) \d x	\\	
			&=	\frac12 \int_{\frac \pi 4}^{\frac{5\pi}{4}} \left(  \sin^2(x) +\cos^2(x) \right) \d x-  \int_{\frac \pi 4}^{\frac{5\pi}{4}} \sin(x)\cos(x)  \d x 	\\
			&=	\frac12 \int_{\frac \pi 4}^{\frac{5\pi}{4}} \d x -  \int_{\frac \pi 4}^{\frac{5\pi}{4}} \sin(x)\cos(x)  \d x \\
			&=	\frac{\pi}{2} -  \int_{\frac \pi 4}^{\frac{5\pi}{4}} \sin(x)\cos(x)  \d x .
	\end{align*}
	To evaluate the last integral, we make the substitution $u = \sin(x)$, so that $\d u = \cos(x) \d x$. Then 
	\[
	 \int_{\frac \pi 4}^{\frac{5\pi}{4}} \sin(x)\cos(x)  \d x  = \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}^{-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} u du = 0.
	\]
	Thus we conclude that the volume of the solid is $\frac{\pi}{2}$.
