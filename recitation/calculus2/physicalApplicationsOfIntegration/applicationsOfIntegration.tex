\section{Discussion Questions}

\begin{problem} The force $F$ (in Newtons) required to stretch a spring $x$ meters from equilibrium obeys Hooke's Law, which states that $F(x) = k x$, where $k$ (in $N$/$m$) is a constant.

Suppose that $k=4 N/m$ and the spring is stretched $5 m$ from equilibrium.  A student claims that since the force required to stretch the spring this distance is $F(5) = 4(5) = 20 N$, so the work required to move it these $5 m$ can be found as follows.
\[
W = F \cdot d = 20 \cdot 5 = 100 J
\]

Determine if the student is correct or incorrect.  If the student is incorrect, provide a correct solution.

\begin{problem}
Newton's Law of Gravitation states that the gravitational force between two particles is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers:

\[
F(r) = \frac{GMm}{r^2},
\]
where $r$ is the distance between the centers of the particles, $M$ and $m$ are the masses of the particles, and $G=6.674 \times 10^{-11} \unit{N \cdot m^2 /kg^2}$ is the constant of proportionality.

Suppose that a rocket ship is launched from the surface of the earth into space.  Write down an integral that calculates the work necessary to launch the rocket ship from the surface of the earth to just beyond the Earth's atmosphere.

You may assume that the Earth can be treated as a particle, the radius of the Earth is $6371000 \unit{m}$,  the mass of the Earth is $5.972 \times 10^{24} \unit{kg}$, the mass of the rocket ship is $505,846 \unit{kg}$, and the distance between the surface of the earth and the edge of the atmosphere${^1}$\footnote{$^1$This is often referred to as the \emph{K{\'a}rm{\'a}n line} and commonly represents the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space.} is $100,000 \unit{m}$.

\begin{problem}

Suppose that the density profile of a wire that extends from $x=0$ to $x=10$ is given by $\rho(x) =2x$.

\begin{itemize}
\item[I.] Does the half of the rod from $x=0$ to $x=5$  have less, equal, or more mass than the half of the rod from $x=5$ to $x=10$?
\item[II.] Suppose that a value for $a$ so the portion of the rod from $x=0$ to $x=a$ has the same mass as the portion of the rod from $x=a$ to $x=10$.  
\item[A.] Without performing any calculations, do you expect $a<5$, $a=5$, or $a>5$?
\item[B.] Find $a$.  Does the result agree with your answer to Part A?
\end{itemize}

\begin{problem}
The force required to displace a particle $x$ units is given by

\[
F(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 8, &0\leq x \leq 2 \\  2+3x,  &2  < x \leq 8  \end{array} \right.

\begin{problem}

An inverted conical tank has base with diameter $6\unit{m}$ and height
$9\unit{m}$. Suppose the tank is filled to a height of $6\unit{m}$
with acetone ($\rho=785 \unit{kg}/\unit{m}^3$). Set up, but do not evaluate, an integral that would give the work required
to pump the acetone out of the tank (use $g=9.8\unit{m}/\unit{s}^2$).

%You want to move a slice at height $y$ to a height of $9$. Letting

%\begin{question}
%The area is $A = \pi r^2$.  We see that $r$ is a horizontal distance, which we must express in terms of $y$.  Hence, $r=  \answer{\frac{1}{3} y}$ and $A=\answer{\pi \left(\frac{y}{3}\right)^2}$.

%Now, substitute all of these relevant quantities into the integral.
