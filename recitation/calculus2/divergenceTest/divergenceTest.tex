\begin{problem}
Suppose that  $a_n = \frac{n^2-2n+4}{2n^2+1}$.  Let $s_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k$. 

\begin{itemize}
\item[I.] Determine if $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n$ exists.  If it does, can you determine its value?
\item[II.] Determine if $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$ exists.  If it does, can you determine its value?
\item[III.] Determine if $\lim_{n \to \infty} s_n$ exists.  If it does, can you determine its value?
\end{itemize}

\begin{freeResponse}
I. By inspection, $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \frac{1}{2}$.

II. Since $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \frac{1}{2} \neq 0$, $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$ diverges by the divergence test.  

Make sure that you realize that information about the \emph{sequence} $\{a_n\}_{n=1}$ here is being used to determine convergence of the \emph{series} (i.e. the attempt to add all of the terms in the sequence together). 

III. The symbols $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$ and $\lim_{n \to \infty} s_n$ are equivalent.  Since $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$ diverges, $\lim_{n \to \infty} s_n$ does not exist.

\begin{problem}
Determine if the following statements are true or false.

I. If the sequence $\{a_n\}$ satisfies $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} a_n = 0$, then the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges.

II. If the sequence $\{a_n\}$ satisfies $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_n \neq 0$, then the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ diverges.

III. If the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges, then $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} a_n = 0$. 

IV. If the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ diverges, then $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} a_n \neq 0$. 



\begin{freeResponse}
I. This statement is false. For example, the harmonic series $\sum \frac{1}{n}$ diverges, while $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0$. 

II. This is the divergence test, and is therefore true.

III. This is true; in order for a series to converge, the infinitely many terms we are trying to add together must tend to $0$.  More formally, this is the contrapositive of the divergence test, so it is true.

IV. This statement is false. For example, the harmonic series $\sum \frac{1}{n}$ diverges, while $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0$.

\begin{problem}
Suppose that the series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ has sequence of partial sums $\{s_n\}$ given by the explicit formula
$$
s_n = \frac{2n+1}{4n+3}.
$$
Student A claims that the series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ converges because $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} s_n = \frac{1}{2}$. Student B claims that $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} s_n = \frac{1}{2} \neq 0$, so the series diverges by the divergence test. Which (if either) student is correct?

\begin{freeResponse}
Student A is correct, by the definition of convergence. Student B is incorrect; the divergence test deals with the limit of the sequence of  terms $a_k$, not the limit of the sequence of partial sums.  The divergence test can be used to conclude that since $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} s_n = \frac{1}{2} \neq 0$, the series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} s_k$ diverges.
\end{freeResponse}

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Given that $\sum_{k=1}^n a_k = \frac{3^n}{3^n+\ln^8(n)}$, determine whether $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k $ converges or diverges.  If it converges, can you determine its value?

\begin{freeResponse}
By now, hopefully it is becoming clear that a lot of information is being stored in the notation used in these problems.  A good strategy before tackling a problem is to take a moment and parse what information is being given.

Note that here, the result of \emph{adding} $a_1$ through $a_n$ is being given, \emph{NOT} an explicit formula for the $n$-th term $a_n$; we are actually told what $s_n$ is!  As such, 

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left[ \sum_{k=1}^n a_k \right] = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left[ \frac{3^n}{3^n+\ln^8(n)} \right] =1. 
\]

Note that this limit can be computed by inspection using the growth rates results since the dominant term in both the numerator and denominator is $3^n$.

\section{Group Work}

\begin{problem}
Let $\{a_n\}_{n=1}$ be a sequence and define $s_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k$.  

I. If $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k =2$, does $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} s_k$ converge or diverge?  

II. If $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k =2$, does $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (a_k+1)$ converge or diverge?  

III. If $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} s_k =2$, does $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$ converge or diverge?  

If a series above converges, can you determine its value? 

\begin{freeResponse}
Note that a sequence $\{a_n\}$ and its corresponding sequence of partial sums $\{s_n\}$ are related by the equality

\[
\sum_{k=k_0}^{\infty} a_k = \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n.
\] 

I. Since $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k =2$, we know that $ \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = 2$.  Since $ \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n \neq 0$, $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} s_k$ diverges by the divergence test.

II. Recall that if $\sum_{k=k_0}^{\infty} a_k$ converges, then $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0$; this is a formalization of the heuristic idea that the only chance that an infinite sum of terms has to converge is if the terms tend to $0$.

Since $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k =2$, we know that $ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0$, and thus $\lim_{n \to \infty} \left(a_n+1\right)  = 1 \neq 0$.  Since $ \lim_{n \to \infty}\left(a_n+1\right) \neq 0$, $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left(a_n+1\right) $ diverges by the divergence test.

\begin{remark}
The notation here is important; there is a huge difference between the symbols $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k+1$ and $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (a_k+1)$.  

\begin{itemize} 
\item The symbol $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k+1$ is interpreted as $\left( \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\right)+1$; that is we add $1$ to the original series.
\item The symbol $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (a_k+1)$ requires that we add $1$ to \emph{each} term $a_k$.
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}
\end{freeResponse}

III. Since $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} s_k =2$, $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} s_k$ is a convergent series, so we know that $ \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = 0$.  Since $ \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n \neq 0$, we have by definition that $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k =0$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Determine whether the series below converge or diverge.  If a series converges, can you determine its value?

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
I. $\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} \frac{(2k^2+1)^2}{k^4-3k+5}$ \qquad  \qquad II. $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \cos\left(\frac{2^k+k^{10}}{3^k}\right)$ \qquad \qquad  III. $\sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2+k}$ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\begin{freeResponse}
I. Comparing the growth rates of the dominant terms in the numerator and denominator, we have 
$$
\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{k^3 - \ln(k+10) + k^5}{(2k+100)^5} = \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \frac{k^5}{2^5 k^5} = \frac{1}{32} .
$$
Since the limit is nonzero, the series diverges by The divergence test.

II. Note that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2^n+n^{10}}{3^n} =0$ by growth rates, so 

\[\lim_{n \to \infty} \cos\left(\frac{2^n+n^{10}}{3^n}\right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \cos(0) =1. \]

Since $\lim_{n \to \infty} \cos\left(\frac{2^n+n^{10}}{3^n}\right) \neq 0$, $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \cos\left(\frac{2^k+k^{10}}{3^k}\right)$ diverges by the divergence test.

\end{freeResponse}

\begin{problem}
For each part, a sequence $\{a_n\}_{n=1}$ is given.  Let $s_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k$ give the terms of the sequence $\{s_n\}_{n=1}$ of partial sums. Determine whether each sequence is increasing, decreasing, bounded above, and/or bounded below. 

I. Let $\{a_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ be the sequence defined by $a_k = \frac{1}{k^3}$ and let $\{s_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ denote its sequence of partial sums. You may take as given that $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}$ converges.

II. Let $\{a_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ be the sequence defined by $a_k = \frac{2^k}{2^k +1}$ and let $\{s_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ denote its sequence of partial sums.  

\begin{freeResponse}
I. The sequence $\{a_k\}$ is monotone decreasing and bounded (above and below), by inspection. Since the terms of $\{a_k\}$ are strictly positive, the sequence $\{s_n\}$ must be monotone increasing. Since $\sum \frac{1}{k^3}$ converges, it follows by the definition of convergence that the sequence $\{s_n\}$ has a finite limit and is therefore bounded.

II. The sequence $\{a_k\}$ is monotone increasing and bounded, since

\[
\frac{2^k}{2^k +1} = \frac{2^k+1 -1}{2^k +1} = \frac{2^k+1}{2^k +1}- \frac{1}{2^k +1} = 1 - \frac{1}{2^k +1}.
\]

Note that $\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} a_k = 1$, so the divergence test implies that the series $\sum a_k$ diverges. It follows that the sequence $\{s_n\}$ is monotone increasing and bounded below (because the terms of $a_k$ are positive), but not bounded above (because $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} s_n = \infty$).
