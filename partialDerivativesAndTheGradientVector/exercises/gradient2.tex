\begin{exercise}
Suppose that $f(x,y) =x^3+3xy$.  Then,

\begin{align*}
\grad{f}(x,y) &= \vector{\answer{3x^2+3y},\answer{3x}} \\
\end{align*}

\begin{exercise}
How many distinct points $(x,y)$ are there for which $\grad{f}(x,y) = \vec{0}$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{none}
\choice[correct]{one}
\choice{two}
\choice{more than two, but finitely many}
\choice{infinitely many}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{hint}
If $\grad{f}(x,y) = \vec{0}$, we must have that the $x$ and $y$ components are zero simultaneously.  Note that the only way the $y$-component can be zero occurs when $x=0$.  How many options does this leave for the $x$-component?
\end{hint}

\begin{exercise}
The point $(x,y)$ for which $\grad{f}(x,y) = \vec{0}$ is $(x,y) = \left(\answer{0},\answer{0} \right)$


\begin{remark}
As it turns out, the points for which $\grad{f}(x,y) = \vec{0}$ will be very important when we try to find relative extrema of a function of two variables.  This exercise gives a little practice with analyzing the gradient to that end.
